# Stack

- Abstract data type where elements are inserted and removed according to the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle.
- The underlying data structure to implement a stack can be an array or a linked list with restricted access to its elements.

In programming, stacks are used to:

- evaluate arithmetic expressions;
- store arguments of functions and result of the functions' calls;
- reverse the order of elements.

### Efficiency

- If used a linked list or classic array (non-resizable) as an internal structure, both push and pop operations always take constant O(1) time.
