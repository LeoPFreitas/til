# Arithmetic operations

## Binary arithmetic operators

- The are called binary because they take two values as operands
- The "/" operator returns the integer part of the division of two integers numbers, and any fractional part is discarded.
- The % in Java is the modulus or remainder operator.

```java
System.out.println(8 / 3); // prints 2
System.out.println(41 / 5); // prints 8

System.out.println(13 + 25); // prints 38

System.out.println(30 - 70); // prints -40

System.out.println(20 * 10); // prints 200

System.out.println(10 % 3) // prints 1, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1
```

## The precedence order

- parentheses
- unary plus/minus
- multiplication, division
- addition, subtraction
