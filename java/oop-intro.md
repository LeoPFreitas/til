# OOP

## Fundamentals

Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects that interact with each other to perform the program functions. Each object can be characterized by a **state** and **behavior.** An object keeps the current state in the **fields** and the behavior in the **methods**

### OOP basic principles

There are four basic principles of OOP. They are **encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance,** and **polymorphism.**

- **Data encapsulation** is the mechanism of hiding the internal data of objects from the world. All interaction with the object and its data are performed through its public methods. Encapsulation allows programmers to protect the object from inconsistency.
- **Data abstraction** means that objects should provide the simplified, abstract version of their implementations. The details of their internal work usually aren't necessary for the user, so there's no need to represent them. Abstraction also means that only the most relevant features of the object will be presented.
- **Inheritance** is a mechanism for defining parent-child relationships between classes. Often objects are very similar, so inheritance allows programmers to reuse common logic and at the same time introduce unique concepts into the classes.
- **Polymorphism** literally means *one name and many forms,* and it concerns the inheritance of the classes. Just as the name suggests, it allows programmers to define different logic of the same method. So, the name (or interface) stays the same, but the actions performed may be different. In practice, it is done with overloading or overriding.

### Objects and Classes

Object

- Programs are made from different objects interacting with each other.
- Attributes characterize objects' data or states
- Methods characterize objects' behavior.

Classes

- Often, many individual objects have similar characteristics. We can say these objects belong to the same type or class
- Describes a common structure of similar objects: their fields and methods.
- An object is an individual instance of a class.

### Tips

- an object-oriented program consists of a set of interacting objects;
- as a rule, the internal state of an object is hidden;
- an object may have characteristics: fields and methods;
- an object is an instance of a class (type);
- a class is a more abstract concept than an individual object; it may be considered a template or blueprint that describes the common structure of a set of similar objects.
