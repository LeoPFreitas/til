# Main method

It is important to mention that a class containing the main method can have any name, but the main method should always have the same name.

## The declaration of the main method

- the keyword `public` indicates that the method can be invoked from everywhere;
- the keyword `static` indicates the method can be invoked without creating an instance of the class;
- the keyword `void` indicates the method doesn't return any value;
- the array variable `args` contains arguments entered at the command line, the array is empty if there are no arguments.
