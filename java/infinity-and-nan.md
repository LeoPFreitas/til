# Infinity and NaN

Java provides three special values for both floating-point types (float and double): `+Infinity`, `-Infinity` and `NaN`.

- `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` is a constant that is greater than any number.
- `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` is a constant that is less than any number.
- `Double.NaN` is a special constant that represents an undetermined value (such as `0 / 0`). It does not equal any
 floating-point or integer number.
